# Extended Euclidean ALgorithm implementation using Rust

This is my implementation of the extended Euclidean's algorithm based on the following questions:

- Implement the extended Euclidean Algorithmto compute the greatest common divisor g of the positive integers a  and b together with a solution (x, y) in integersto the equation
ax + by = gcd(a,b)

- Fix your program so that it deals with the case where b = 0 correctly

- Note that if (x, y) is a solution then (x + b, y - a) will also be a solution. With this in mind, modify your program so that it always returns a solution with x > 0. (not yet implemented)
