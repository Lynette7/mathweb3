# Euclidean ALgorithm for calculating the gcd of two numbers

This is my implementation of Euclidean's algorithm based on the following question:

Write a program to compute the greatest common divisor gcd(a, b) of two integers a nad b. Ensure that your program work even if either a or b is zero. Make sure that you don't go into an infinite loop if a nad b are both zero.
